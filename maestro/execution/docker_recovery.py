"""Fail-closed recovery classification for docker-backed executions.

`probe_execution` answers a single question during crash recovery: "is it
safe to silently re-READY this entity, or might a container from the
previous attempt still be alive?" Any ambiguity (a found container in any
state, more than one match, a label mismatch, or a docker-daemon error)
answers "no" — the caller must route the entity to human review instead of
quietly re-running it over a possibly-live container.

`gc_terminal_handle` is a separate, narrower operation: for a handle whose
*entity* has already reached a terminal status (finalize ran; only the
container cleanup confirmation is missing), it performs an ownership-checked
`docker rm` so leftover containers don't accumulate. It never changes entity
status — callers are responsible for updating the handle's persisted state.
