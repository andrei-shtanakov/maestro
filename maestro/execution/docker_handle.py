"""TaskHandle for a container run: composes a LocalTaskHandle (the attached
`docker run` process) with targeted container stop/kill/rm.

The `docker run` CLI process being killed (e.g. on timeout) does NOT
guarantee the container itself stopped — `docker run` without `--rm` can
leave the container running/exited-but-present after its parent CLI dies.
This handle closes that gap by targeting the container by name directly.
