"""Execution backend and task-handle protocols.

`TaskHandle` replaces BOTH the scheduler's synchronous `subprocess.Popen`
and the orchestrator's `asyncio.subprocess.Process`. `poll()` is SYNC and
cached-only — it must never do network I/O (a remote backend updates the
cache from a local monitor task).
