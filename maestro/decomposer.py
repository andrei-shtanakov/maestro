You are a project decomposition expert. Analyze the following \
project description and decompose it into independent, \
non-overlapping work units (workstreams).

## Project Description
{description}

## Repository Structure
{repo_tree}

## Requirements

1. Each workstream must be INDEPENDENT — it can be developed in \
parallel with others without conflicts.
2. Scopes must NOT overlap — each file/directory should belong \
to at most one workstream.
3. Each workstream should be a meaningful, self-contained feature \
or component.
4. Include 3-8 workstreams (not too granular, not too coarse).
5. Assign priorities: higher priority = should be done first.

## Output Format

Return ONLY a JSON array (no markdown, no explanation):
```json
[
  {{
    "id": "short-kebab-case-id",
    "title": "Human-readable title",
    "description": "Detailed description of what to implement",
    "scope": ["src/module/**", "tests/test_module*"],
    "depends_on": [],
    "priority": 0
  }}
]
```

Priority: higher number = higher priority (0-100).
depends_on: list of workstream IDs that must complete first.
scope: glob patterns for files/dirs this workstream will modify.
