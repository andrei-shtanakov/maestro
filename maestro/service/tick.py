    `key` is the caller's already-resolved repository identity (spec §3) —
    this wrapper does not derive one on its own, so every acquirer of the
    stage lock for one repository uses the same key.

    `run_id` is the run this tick is advancing, and it is what makes
    liveness *observable* (spec §B.3): the stage lock proves only that
    "an orchestration stage is live in this repository", so without the
    holder's id a collector cannot tell the live run from an interrupted
    one and classifies **both** as interrupted — which is exactly what
    `select_resumable` then offers up for a second, concurrent resume.
    It is resolved by the caller for the same reason `key` is; this
    wrapper must never derive it, least of all from the database's parent
    directory name, which for a legacy `--db` would fabricate the run id
    `maestro` out of `~/.maestro/maestro.db`. `None` is therefore the
    honest value whenever the caller has no run identity: the holder
    sidecar stays unwritten and liveness stays *unobserved*, which reads
    as interrupted — conservative, and never a fabricated attribution.

    The lock decides `skipped_running` before anything else happens, and
    a skip is still recorded — an unattended run must leave evidence
    even when it did nothing.
